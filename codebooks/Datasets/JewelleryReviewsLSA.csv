21185,"I bought this ring as a Valentine's gift but couldn't give it since the hands holding the heart symbol would reverse whenever the ring spins (there are 4 of them on this ring, alternating the facing direction). It's a cute ring so I just kept it for myself.",3

37896,my only wish on this ring is- I wish the cut potrion went all the way around the ring. Other than that a great very comfortable ring.,4
51030,"The ring was shipped accordingly and I love the shipping pace.

39606,I haven't even ordered this ring but i read the reviews for it. If you notice picture 1 and pictures 2/3 are two different rings. I was going to order the ring but it seems that the ring received is the 2nd/3rd ring which has a smaller cross design.,4

33813,"This is my favorite ring. Also one of the first rings I ever bought. So if you are new to buying pewter rings, here's something that may help you out. Pewter rings tend to be a bit more bulkier than other types of rings and the metal is softer. Past that I liked this ring, the design of the dead bugs and snakes catches a lot of attention.",4
42026,the product came very fast and was just like how amazon explained itthe ring is very clearly written NO WAR and thick which i likebut i guess if you like small rings this isnt your ring,4

45856,"I could see the quality work in this rosary. I was pleased when I opened the container and I could immediately smell olive wood. There was only one thing buyers need to be aware of when buying this item that wasn't mentioned in the description. The Holy Land Sand is present in a compartment on the rosary. In my opinion, this adds to the quality of the rosary so I'm not sure why the seller didn't describe this fact. I'll be looking for more items from this seller.",4

3865,What sparkle. It is so pretty and dainty. Just what I was looking for.,4
42077,This is a solid.beautiful ring. But if you are expecting the color in rhe picture you will be disappointed. It is barely pink at all. When I first saw it I thought it was lavendar. It's still pretty but buy for design not color.,4
53750,This is a beautiful piece. I looked for a long time to replace the hamsa hand that was given to me in Egypt. This one is perfect. It's delicate and sturdy and lovely to look at. The detail is so pretty and elegant. I wear it often,4

39620,"This ring is gorgeous and fits right in with the other sterling silver Celtic rings that I have. I was a little worried at first with the size of the band since it's a 10 and I wear a 9 but the band is very wide and the ring fits perfectly and is hardly loose at all. Even though this is a mans ring it isn't to big or clunky, a must have for all lovers of Celtic rings!

6522,I love the ring and suggest every girl should have this ring in their jewelry collection.,5
34529,"My wife needed a ring to wear since her actual wedding ring was lost. We were not expecting a one million dollar ring of course. But what arrived not only turned our heads, her co-workers actually noticed this ring more than they ever noticed her old ring. The Cubic Zirconia looks authentic enough under basic scrutiny that we may never go back to a diamond ring again. Me myself, my wedding ring has always been just a silver band but I believe this ring truly defies the subliminal misconception that she deserves a diamond.Great for your temporary ring, or if she doesnt care about price, a perfect choice for those who want to turn heads without breaking the bank",5
19647,"I checked around jewelry stores for prices and I couldn't find any rings that could even compare to this! It is not a huge ring but it is definitely not microscopic either.

I am really glad that I decided to go with this ring, even though I was kind of nervous ordering a ring online.",5
45289,"I bought this for my 17 year old daughter who had seen a small heart shaped ring at the Coach store and liked the style. This one was much cheaper and ended up being so much prettier! It's really an eye catching ring, doesn't look cheap and sparkles beautifully. I am actually ordering her a second ring since she will be leaving for college next month and is worried about losing it. I think she'll like knowing there is a spare ring at home just in case and for the price it's not a big deal. She wears this ring on her right ring finger instead of her high school ring because she loves it that much. I would suggest this ring for any fan of hearts and a little bit of bling!",5
33620,"I do love this ring and I wear it all the time. I bought it to wear when my husband and I go on vacation so I don't have to worry about losing my real ring. The stone is already lose but it is a $50 ring and not a $5000 ring. Almost every time I leave the house I get a compliment on this ring. My mom cannot tell the different between this ring and my real wedding ring. It is a little bulkier then the picture leads one to believe, but it is still a wonderful ring. If anything happens and the stone does fall out, I will probably buy another ring because of how much I love this ring.",5

The size and color of the stone suit my taste perfectly, and the quality of the ring is excellent. I have quite a variety of silver rings, and this ring is one that I wear on a regular basis. My taste in rings is more toward the bold/unique side, and this ring definitely fits the bill!",5
50467,"I bought this ring in a size 3 for a toe ring. It came much sooner than expected, this was the first surprise. Second surprise was the absolutely cute heart-shaped box with a bow on top that the ring came in! And the third surprise was the ring itself which fit perfectly and was totally true to the picture and looked even better in person. I'm already shopping for my second Gem Avenue ring!Kudos to Gem Avenue for supplying small rings for people who like fitted toe rings!!",5

48772,"Great ring! I tried a different one first but the individual rings were so thin that they snapped within a few weeks. The rings on this one are thicker, making it a bolder and more durable ring. Of course it costs a bit more but you can't go wrong paying for better quality!",5

Gemstones are very cloudy and some of the joints in the chain or fused together and the bracelet therefore can't be straightened out completely.

46500,The Earrings you sent me are real light in color not the pretty dark color you show in the picture. They look almost light pink. I will keep them they are also pretty but not what I expected.,4

50197,The look is very beautiful with a smooth finish. It closes firmly with a clic and has a classic look.,5

33632,"I usually love rings from this company but be warned that this ring doesn't look anything like the picture. The ring I received had a super long rectangular stone, not a nice square as seen in the picture. Mine was also tarnished or looked like it had torch marks up the side. I will definitely be returning this ring.",2
38637,"I was a little disappointed when I received my ring in the mail. In the picture provided above the sides look like they make a heart shape, or at least it looks like smooth, clean curved lines. The ring I got in the mail looks like the sides are smushed in and not clean curves. Other then that I like it. I just wished it looked like the picture.",3
7110,"The diamonds in the picture are nothing close to the size they look in the picture but the ring is awesome and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone for the price. Hands down, no doubt. The ring looks amazing for the price. Just don't expect the diamonds to look as big as they do in the picture.",4
6649,I received my ring and was a little disappointed that the ring is not completely blue (like the picture shows). It looks like I got a blue flower with green leaves. So it makes the ring look blue and green. Very small ring. Not worth $6.99 but more like $3.,3
51356,"This ring looks beautiful in the picture but when you see it in reality, the cubic zirconia so small and the ring looks so tiny. Also, the cubic zirconia is dull. The ring I received looks like it was worn. Very disgusted with my purchase. Won't buy from this seller again. I do not like false imaging. The ring looks cheap and should be sold for much less. A real rip-off!",1
44358,"I got this ring hoping that it looks like the picture which was misleading. If you purchase this ring, please be aware that it is 1/10 cttw which means that the diamonds are really small.

943,"It looks like a ring for a man when you look at the picture online, but in real life its a very feminine looking ring.",1
37864,I fell in love with the picture. The ring showed to be sligthly brushed looking. When the ring arrived I was quick to learn the picture looks nothing like the ring.

10037,These are not what I thought they were going to be they look good in the picture but when I got them the quality just isn't there. I can't wear them with out completely bending the hooks out of shape. They are more like silver plastic.,1
