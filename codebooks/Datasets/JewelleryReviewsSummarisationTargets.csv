1,I will not be buying this ring again. I will not be ordering from Amazon or this jeweler in the future. The first shipment of this ring had scratches on the diamond. Very disappointed in the appearance and quality.
2,It was not worth returning it as you would pay more for postage than what the ring cost. The ring was nice and looked like picture but had a crack in one Garnet and another one had a large chip. I would recommend you spend it a little bit more and buy a better looking ring. I'm very disappointed with amazon for the lack of description.
3,This ring is a beautiful ring but the first shipment of this ring had scratches on the diamond and was missing 2 diamonds. I was not sure if the diamonds were actually blue or not. I was a little disappointed with the size of the rings. Only thing is you cant have this ring resized.
4,I love the shipping pace. The ring itself is beautiful. I have been looking for a ring that is so beautiful and unique. This is a solid.beautiful ring. But if you are expecting the color in rhe picture you will be disappointed. I love this ring my only complaint is that the metal is so soft.
5,This ring is gorgeous. I love the ring and would recommend it to anyone who likes to wear a ring. I am a huge fan of the ring and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a ring. I am so glad I bought this ring.
